category: "AI Systems Engineering"

client: "Macion Ventures"
problem: |
  An operator-led venture incubation arm needed a repeatable way to triage, brief, and ledger new
  business ideas — without one human bottleneck, and without the agent that proposes a decision
  being the same one that approves it.
approach: |
  Built a **7-agent pipeline** (5 judgment-tier + 2 mechanical) with 10 lifecycle skills and an
  **anti-self-approval governance pattern**: the agent that proposes never approves. Encoded
  Philippine tax / regulatory rules (DTI / SEC / BIR / LGU, ₱3M VAT threshold, 8%-flat vs graduated
  election) directly into agent and skill prompts so the research output is jurisdiction-aware at
  the prompt level — not bolted on at the end.
evidence:
  - "**31 decision-grade artifacts** (charters, briefs, ledger entries) shipped"
  - "**Anti-self-approval** governance pattern documented as a reusable convention"
  - "**Jurisdiction-aware prompting** for PH tax/regulatory rules"
outcome: |
  Produced a clean separation-of-duties trail — every proposal had a corresponding validator hand-off,
  the validator never originated the proposal, and every decision was ledgered for later audit.
  The same separation-of-duties principle was reused at 19V for LLM research validation.
proof:
  - "31 artifacts on disk (charters, briefs, ledgers)"
  - "Reuse pattern documented in 19V engagement methodology"
