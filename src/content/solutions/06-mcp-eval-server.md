title: "Eval MCP Server — 31 Gates as First-Class Tools"
slug: "eval-mcp-server"
category: "AI Systems Engineering"
order: 6
client: "Self-directed / OSS"
problem: |
  LLM eval harnesses live in code or in spreadsheets — neither is a clean integration target for
  multi-agent pipelines. A multi-agent system needs the eval gates exposed as **tools**, not as
  Python imports.
approach: |
  Built an **MCP server** that exposes the 31-gate statistical evaluation harness as discoverable
  tools. Each gate has a typed contract (input schema, output schema, exit codes). An agent can
  dispatch a strategy candidate through the gate stack via MCP without owning the implementation.
  **The mechanical validator enforces exit-0** before downstream agents consume the result.
evidence:
  - "**MCP-compliant** server (Claude Agent SDK / Cursor / etc. can connect)"
  - "**31 typed tools** (one per gate)"
  - "**Exit-0 contract** enforced by mechanical validator"
  - "**No agent can bypass** the gate stack when calling downstream"
outcome: |
  The eval harness becomes the **single source of truth** for what counts as "passed validation" —
  whether the input is an LLM output or a systematic strategy. Reusable across projects.
proof:
  - "Open-source repo (eval-mcp-server) with scorecard"
  - "Documented in AI portfolio README"
