title: "8-Agent Editorial Production Pipeline (SLOP ↓ 96%)"
slug: "8-agent-editorial-pipeline"
category: "AI Systems Engineering"
order: 3
client: "Editorial AI / Content Automation"
problem: |
  A high-volume editorial workflow was generating content with a measurable "slop index" — generic,
  templated, easily-detected text. Quality gate was after-the-fact and manual. Production scaled
  faster than the editorial team could review.
approach: |
  Built an **8-agent content production pipeline** with a **SLOP-scanner** (proprietary eval gate)
  woven into the pipeline as a mechanical validator. The scanner measured the proportion of stock
  phrases, hedge words, and un-statistical copy against a baseline corpus, and gated publication.
  Agents were chartered to **rewrite before publishing**, not to publish first and edit later.
evidence:
  - "**SLOP index dropped from 81 → 3** on the working corpus"
  - "**Mechanical validator** enforced the gate (exit-0 contract)"
  - "**Rewrite-before-publish** semantics in the agent charter"
outcome: |
  Production volume held; editorial-review labor fell (the gate did the rejection). The
  SLOP-scanner is one of the OSS projects in the AI portfolio (separate repo).
proof:
  - "Scorecard JSON for the SLOP scanner is OSS"
  - "Pipeline charter documented in editorial-ai engagement"
