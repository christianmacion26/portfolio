slug: "lookahead-bias-audit"
category: "Quantitative Research"

client: "Self-directed / Portfolio"
problem: |
  Look-ahead bias is silent: a backtest that uses future data looks great until you deploy it.
  A serious research portfolio needs an **explicit audit suite** — a checklist of failure modes
  with mechanical tests.
approach: |
  Built a **look-ahead-bias audit suite** with mechanical tests for the most common failure modes:
  point-in-time dataset verification (using public timestamps, not internal close-times), survivorship
  bias checks, rebalance-time vs. signal-time consistency, and frozen-spec evaluation. Each test is
  a gate that has to pass before a candidate is allowed to report a number.
evidence:
  - "**Point-in-time** dataset verification"
  - "**Survivorship bias** checks"
  - "**Rebalance/signal timing** consistency tests"
  - "**Frozen-spec evaluation** prevents post-hoc tuning"
outcome: |
  The audit suite is run on every strategy candidate. A pass means the candidate's reported
  numbers are point-in-time consistent and have not been tuned to the test set.
