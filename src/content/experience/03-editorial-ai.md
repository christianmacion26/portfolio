Built an **8-agent content-production pipeline** (topic-scout → researcher → drafter → editor → producer → art-director → chart-maker → exporter) and a 290-line **AI-output (slop) evaluator** scoring drafts on 13 literature-grounded metrics; drove a real draft from **HEAVY (index 81) to CLEAN (index 3)**.

Engineered a **dependency-free rendering pipeline** (HTML/SVG → headless-Chrome PNG; Markdown → publish-ready PDF) so the output side of the platform runs without LLM API costs.

Demonstrated that AI-assisted editorial work can be made **measurable**: each draft's slop score, iteration delta, and shipped-iteration provenance are all logged.
